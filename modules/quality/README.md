# Quality Module

Quality analysis and validation functionality.

## Purpose

Handles all quality-related operations including:
- Data quality assessment
- Field validation
- Quality scoring
- Warning generation

## Files to Move Here

- `quality-analyzer.js` - Main quality analysis (AI calls extracted to ai/services)
- `core/field-quality-analyzer.js` - Field-specific quality checks
- `brand-validation-manager.js` - Brand validation logic
- `swedish-spellchecker.js` - Spelling validation

## Benefits

- ✅ Centralized quality assessment
- ✅ Clean separation from AI logic
- ✅ Easier to maintain quality standards
