# üéØ AI Module - Master Plan & Architecture Guide

**CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST** - This file contains the complete architecture plan, current status, and development guidelines. Always consult this before making changes to ensure consistency with the overall refactoring strategy.

## üö® CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT

The original codebase suffered from:
- **Massive files**: api-manager.js (94KB, 2050 lines), quality-analyzer.js (121KB, 3199 lines), add-items-tooltip-manager.js (159KB, 4442 lines)
- **Scattered AI logic**: Prompts and rules duplicated across multiple files
- **Conflicting behavior**: Different AI rules in different places
- **Unmaintainable**: "Way too many files" making development counterproductive

## üéØ REFACTORING STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Build New Architecture (CURRENT)**
‚úÖ Create modular, reusable AI components  
‚úÖ Establish single source of truth for AI behavior  
‚úÖ Test each component thoroughly before integration  
‚úÖ Keep existing code working during transition  

### **Phase 2: Integration (NEXT)**
üîÑ Replace scattered logic with clean module calls  
üîÑ Gradually migrate functionality from massive files  
üîÑ Test each integration step thoroughly  

### **Phase 3: Cleanup (FUTURE)**
‚è≥ Remove deprecated code and massive files  
‚è≥ Optimize performance and memory usage  
‚è≥ Final testing and documentation
