# üéØ AI Module - Master Plan & Architecture Guide

**CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST** - This file contains the complete architecture plan, current status, and development guidelines. Always consult this before making changes to ensure consistency with the overall refactoring strategy.

## üö® CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT

The original codebase suffered from:
- **Massive files**: api-manager.js (94KB, 2050 lines), quality-analyzer.js (121KB, 3199 lines), add-items-tooltip-manager.js (159KB, 4442 lines)
- **Scattered AI logic**: Prompts and rules duplicated across multiple files
- **Conflicting behavior**: Different AI rules in different places
- **Unmaintainable**: "Way too many files" making development counterproductive

## üéØ REFACTORING STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Build New Architecture (CURRENT)**
‚úÖ Create modular, reusable AI components  
‚úÖ Establish single source of truth for AI behavior  
‚úÖ Test each component thoroughly before integration  
‚úÖ Keep existing code working during transition  

### **Phase 2: Integration (NEXT)**
üîÑ Replace scattered logic with clean module calls  
üîÑ Gradually migrate functionality from massive files  
üîÑ Test each integration step thoroughly  

### **Phase 3: Cleanup (FUTURE)**
‚è≥ Remove deprecated code and massive files  
‚è≥ Optimize performance and memory usage  
‚è≥ Final testing and documentation

## üéØ DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### **ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üîí SAFETY FIRST**
   - Never modify existing working code during module creation
   - Create new modules in isolation
   - Test thoroughly before integration
   - Keep existing functionality working

2. **üß© MODULAR DESIGN**
   - Each module has a single, clear responsibility
   - Modules are reusable across different contexts
   - Clean interfaces with minimal dependencies
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **üìù CONSISTENT PATTERNS**
   - Use ES6 modules with named exports
   - Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
   - Follow the established naming conventions
   - Add validation and error handling

4. **üß™ TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**
   - Create test files for each new module
   - Test all functionality including edge cases
   - Remove test files after successful validation
   - Document test results in commit messages

5. **üíæ INTELLIGENT CACHING**
   - Cache expensive operations (prompt generation, model selection)
   - Provide cache management methods (clear, stats)
   - Use appropriate cache keys and invalidation
   - Monitor memory usage

### **COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:**
```
‚úÖ STEP X: [Module Name] - [Brief Description]
- NEW: [New files created]
- FEATURES: [Key features implemented]
- TESTED: [What was tested]
- SAFE: [Safety confirmation]
- BENEFITS: [Benefits achieved]
- NEXT: [Next step]
```

## üöÄ INTEGRATION STRATEGY

When ready for integration:

1. **Identify Integration Points**
   - Map current api-manager.js methods to new modules
   - Identify dependencies and call patterns
   - Plan gradual replacement strategy

2. **Create Adapter Layer**
   - Build compatibility layer for existing code
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition
   - Provide migration path for each component

3. **Incremental Migration**
   - Replace one component at a time
   - Test each replacement thoroughly
   - Keep rollback options available
